# SambaScan
An experimental hobby project to crawl the Samba resources on the local network, Mar 2005.

It was supposed to be a part of a file-sharing search engine for a local network I once worked for. 

It is (was in 2005) able to scan the Samba-shared hosts on the network, their resources and all their folders & files,
and to store them in a databased in an easily searchable & indexable form for web UI.

_Uploaded to GitHub in 2011 for historical purposes._
